# Creating a portfolio with Vercel

I'm still in the initial phases of experimenting with Vercel, but already it is serving my purposes well beyond my expectations. Within an hour I had my resume up at my domain I had purchased.

Making updates is as easy as pushing changes to the project to git/main. Creating or modifying a blog post is as easy as creating or editing a markdown page under the posts directory.

In the past I would usually spin up a small VPS from Digital Ocean and spend a lot of time on configuration details, and server architecture.

For small websites, this service is ideal, and I would definitely recommend it. I have yet to see what the more advanced options of Vercel yield, but I am excited to find out!
